## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

It's been a while since I last updated this but yeah, let's start with the basics. I'm Will/CG360 and I go by He/They pronouns. ^^ - Currently, I'm in Year 13 studying Computer Science, Maths, and Physics and I should be completing my A-Levels in May if the dinosaurs aren't resurrected! Most of my favourite projects involve me writing useful APIs or just creating fun games for other people to enjoy, hence why I'm currently leading the development effort at MadBlock Games!

Laungage-wise, I've tinkered around with a few in the past. My go-to favourites are C# + Java for larger projects and Python for smaller projects. Recently, I've been dabbling with Rust, C++, and Go for other projects ðŸ‘€

Oh and my favourite game? I would be torn between Minecraft and Super Metroid if someone asked me that.

Also, cats are nice. Send me some <3

### What am I working on?

Currently, I'm working on a few large changes to MadBlock as well as my Computer Science coursework so it's been pretty busy. I should be back to writing a few open source projects in no time. ðŸ˜Ž
